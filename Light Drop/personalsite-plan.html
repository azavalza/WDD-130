        Comparison chart for Standard Lightdrop and Infrared Lightdrop comparing 7 features.</p>
        
      <p>Waterproof - The ocean is no limit for the Lightdrop. The silicon material provides a full cover for delicate pieces of technology inside. This allows lightdrop to be able to be fully submerged in water and work just as perfect. It can reach up to 20 ft underwater so you can make the underwater world your playground. 
      </p>
      <p>
       Material - Lightdrop is made from a soft but durable, and flexible silicon material. Our engineers have invested in the highest quality silicon made for lamps that will not only cover the LEDs but enhance them. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Light - We have created a small lantern with a powerful light source. Our technicians have placed inside LEDs that produce over 1200 lumens. The infrared model is just as bright, but red. It emits infrared rays ranging from 800nm to 1mm wavelength. 
      </p>
      <p>
       Battery - In our team we have decided that batteries is a thing from the past. Lightdrop comes with a charger so that you never have to buy batteries for a lantern again. A full charge of 2 hours will give you 12 hours of use. Don’t have 2 hours? Turn on speedlight mode and in 15 minutes of charge, your lightdrop will be good for 5 hours.

      <h3>[Page 3]</h3>
      <p>
      We have always wondered if there was a lantern that could do it all. A lantern that could be brought underwater, dropped, squeezed, emit heat. However, when we imagined all of this, we would imagine a monstrous light. At Lightdrop our goal was to make things simple and create a practical product that could adapt to anything. That is how the idea of lightdrop was turned on. Our product gives you the most with less. Lightdrop allows you to bring light to any situation without having to carry a heavy unconventional object. This is a product that adapts to your situation, and will never disappoint you.
