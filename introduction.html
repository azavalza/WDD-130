    <h2>Alex</h2>
    <p>Hola! My name is Alejandro and I am from Puerto Vallarta, Mexico. It is a small city in the West coast of Mexico filled with 
        a lot of adventures. I've lived there for most of my life and I served in the South of Mexico in a city called Merida. 
       
    <p>One of my favorite hobbies is to explore and go backpacking. I always seek for new experiences and to meet new people along the way. My 
        dream is to one day hike the mountains of Switzerland. I am also passionate about film and creating content. I like photography and I enjoy making videos for others to see. My major is
        computer science and so far I have liked it. I haven't gotten to the heavy stuff so hopefully I keep enjoying it in the future. <p>
